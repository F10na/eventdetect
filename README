This repository contains a set of event detection algorithms for streams of human data (mostly
eye movement data), implemented in Python.

Documentation for each algorithm is included in comments in the files in the detect/
directory.

The 'test.py' file is the best one to run to get an idea of the way to instantiate the
library and chain together filters and detection algorithms.
